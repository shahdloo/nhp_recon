Awake NHP fMRI reconstruction with dynamic off-resonance correction

This is a MWE demonstrating the technique described in the following references
* Shahdloo M., Papp D., Schüffelgen U., Miller K., and Chiew M. (2021). Model-based dynamic off-resonance correction for improved accelerated fMRI in awake behaving non-human primates. bioRxiv

A robust tool capable of parsing and reconstructing awake NHP raw fMRI data would follow shortly.
